# Populating an excel sheet with Gspread library

This project allows you to upload the contents of a Pandas DataFrame to a Google Sheet using the gspread library. Specifically, it checks if a worksheet with a specified title exists in the spreadsheet. If the worksheet doesn't exist, it creates one. It then populates the worksheet with the headers and values from the DataFrame.


here is a link to the spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CpGvA2oy0FOdC-IdyFeO2JDkaiWxY9sX1cO6Vl8Zz04/edit?usp=sharing
